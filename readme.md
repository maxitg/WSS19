## The Simplest Set Replace Rules [Homework]
The homework is a computational essay that enumerates [SetReplace](https://github.com/maxitg/SetReplace) systems with sizes up to 8.

### Build
To build the notebook:
1. Open the [./Homework/Drafts/ComputationalEssay.nb](Homework/Drafts/ComputationalEssay.nb).
2. Do Evaluation -> Evaluate Notebook, when asked to evaluate initialization cells, press "Yes" or "No", does not matter.
3. If you do not have [SetReplace](https://github.com/maxitg/SetReplace) installed, you will be asked to install it. Click "OK".
4. Wait for all cells to evaluate (that takes a while).
5. Save the evaluated notebook elsewhere, from now on, it is only necessary to evaluate initialization cells to view the notebook.
